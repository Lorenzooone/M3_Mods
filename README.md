# M3_Text_Skipping
Repository for development of a "Text skipping" Mod for M3

The idea is to make it so if you're holding a certain combination of buttons (A),
text is skipped. Textual cutscenes' text should be automatically skipped as well.

To build, place a ROM named mother3.gba in the folder with these files, then use i.bat.
